shows the relationship between them,
it is commonly used to summarize the count of occurences  for two or more categorical
variables,
and helps to understand how these variables are related.

> In the context of contigency table, marginal probability is the probability of
    a single event, happening regardless of other factors.

>   its calculated based on the totals of the rows or columns of the table.
    these rows and column totals are know as marginal totals.

> To find the marginal probability of an event divide the marginal total,
    by the grand total.

> contigency with marginal totals, are specially helpful, in analysing relationship
    between categorical variables, calculating various types of probabilities.
