"""
used to model the probability of a certain number of events, occuring within a
a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events, happen within a known
constant average rate, Independently of each other.

Characteristics :
    > Discrete distribution :
        Describes rare events
        each occurences is independent of occurence of others.
        It Describes descret occurences over an interval.
        The occurence at each interval can range from 0 to infinity. [ âˆž ]
        expected number occurences must hold constant through out the experiment.

Calculate the probability of getting exactly 7 customers in one hour
when the average arrival rate is 10 customers per hour.
