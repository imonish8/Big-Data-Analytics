A companyâ€™s employee salaries are normally distributed with a mean of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $8,000.
   - a) What percentage of employees earn more than $60,000?
   - b) If we randomly select a sample of 30 employees, what is the probability that their average salary will be between $48,000 and $52,000?

#empirical guess is mean - 1*std = 68 so 72% approx. just a guess before calculations.
