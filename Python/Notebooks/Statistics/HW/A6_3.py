 Spam Classification with Multiple Words

   **Question**: Extend the email spam example where now
   weâ€™re looking at the presence of two words: "Offer" and "Free".

   Suppose:
   - 40% of emails are spam.
   - 65% of spam emails contain "Offer" and 80% contain "Free".
   - 20% of non-spam emails contain "Offer" and 5% contain "Free".
   - 45% of spam emails contain both "Offer" and "Free".
   - 3% of non-spam emails contain both "Offer" and "Free".

   Calculate:
   - The probability that an email is spam given it contains "Offer".
   - The probability that an email is spam given it contains "Free".
   - The probability that an email is spam given it contains both "Offer" and "Free".
