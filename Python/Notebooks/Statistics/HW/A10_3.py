Steps to Calculate

	1.	Collect Data: Record weight loss for all Exercise Type and Diet Plan combinations.
	2.	Model Effects:
	•	Main effects: Exercise Type and Diet Plan.
	•	Interaction effect: Combination of both.
	3.	Check Hypotheses:
	•	Null: No interaction effect.
	•	Alternative: Interaction effect exists.
	4.	Calculate F-Statistic: Compare interaction variance with residual variance.
	5.	Interpret  p -Value: If  p < 0.05 , the interaction is significant.

Interpretation

A significant interaction means the effect of Exercise Type depends
on Diet Plan (e.g., Cardio works better with Keto, Strength Training with Vegan).
