Two tailed test :
    > When both parameter H(0) and H(1) are bidirection, not
    restricted to go in specific direction without mentioning decrease
    increase in main statement.

    Best scenario is A Teacher introducing a new method of teaching,
    before new method avg class score was 70, after new method introduction,
    avg score is 75, here Null Hypothesis will be Score is not changed,
    H(0) = 70 Not changed, Alt Hypothesis is Score changed (h(1)) we do not
    know weather it is due to New mthod or something else.
    p-value will determine wather the Null Hypothesis rejected or fail to
    reject.

One Tailed test :
    > One tailed test determines in either direction, only in increase or
    only in decrease but not at the same timeboth.
    > Example if you want to test the drug is effectivity is increased by 10% ?
        here we are intereed and focused on increased by 10%
    > Redbull company claims their drink can make you fly  high 10%
    only interested in 10% fly High.
    H : DRINK DOES NOT FLY HIGH 10%
    H : DRINK DOES FLY MORE THAN 10%
