Introduction to Core Algorithms
	•	The module covers foundational machine learning algorithms used within TensorFlow, including:
	1.	Linear Regression
	2.	Classification
	3.	Clustering
	4.	Hidden Markov Models
	•	These algorithms are widely applicable across businesses and applications and are the building blocks for advanced techniques
	like neural networks.

Linear Regression: The Basics

    Linear regression is introduced as one of the most basic yet powerful machine learning techniques.
	1.	Purpose:
	    •	To establish a linear relationship between variables.
	    •	To predict the dependent variable (Y) given an independent variable (X).
	2.	Key Concepts:
	    •	Line of Best Fit:
	    •	A straight line through data points that best represents the **relationship between variables.**
	    •	Used for prediction.
	    •	Linear Correlation:
	    •	A situation where changes in one variable correspond linearly to changes in another.
	3.	Example:
	    •	A scatterplot of data is visualized, and the line of best fit is drawn to demonstrate predictions.
	    •	The equation of the line: ￼
	    •	￼: Slope of the line.
	    •	￼: Y-intercept.
	    •	Example Use Case:
	        •	Predicting a student’s final grade based on their midterm grades.
	        •	Example of higher dimensions: Predicting variables with 8-9 input features and one output.

    Mathematical Explanation
	    1.	Slope Calculation:
	        •	Slope (￼) is calculated as ￼, which measures the steepness of the line.
	        •	Example: Choose two points, calculate the difference in Y values (rise) and divide it by the difference in X values (run).
	    2.	Predictions Using the Line Equation:
	        •	Input the value of ￼ into the equation to predict ￼.
	        •	Example:
	            •	Given ￼, calculate ￼.
	    3.	Higher Dimensions:
	        •	Linear regression can extend to three or more dimensions.
	        •	Example:
	        •	Predict ￼ given ￼ and ￼ using a three-dimensional line (plane).

Applications of Linear Regression
	•	Predicting student grades based on past performance.
	•	Estimating future life expectancy based on age and health conditions.
	•	Predicting future outcomes (e.g., average temperature trends).

Implementation Using TensorFlow
	1.	Setup and Dependencies:
	    •	Install required libraries: sklearn, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
	    •	Key libraries:
	    •	NumPy: Handles multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations.
	    •	pandas: Data manipulation and visualization.
	    •	matplotlib: For plotting data.
	    •	TensorFlow: Machine learning framework.
	2.	Workflow:
	    •	Define the version of TensorFlow (2.x) and import dependencies.
	    •	Understand the importance of feature columns in TensorFlow:
	    •	Feature columns represent the features (independent variables) of the dataset in TensorFlow.
	3.	Coding and Dataset Preparation:
	    •	The dataset is imported and prepared for training.
	    •	Use sklearn for additional tools if necessary.

Core Takeaways
	    •	Linear regression is a simple yet powerful tool to predict outputs based on linear relationships.
	    •	While TensorFlow supports complex algorithms, mastering these foundational techniques is crucial for building more advanced models.
	    •	Linear regression’s versatility makes it suitable for various applications, including predictions in multidimensional datasets.
